    <p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> allow you to run a series of actions on your code based on various triggers. This includes actions such as compiling the code or running unit tests, which are performed by a "<a href="https://github.com/actions/runner">runner</a>" system. This system can either on be a virtual environment on the GitHub infrastructure or a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners">locally hosted server</a>.</p>

    <h2>Using a self-hosted runner</h2>
    <p>The common reasons to run a self-hosted runner is that you might want to use GitHub Actions, but are on a network that is firewalled off, you have software that might be easier to configure ahead of time, or have security concerns about information being used by the GitHub infrastructure</p>
    
    <h2>Some tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When developing GitHub Actions, you can make the logging and what's shown more verbose via by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging">enabling different types of logging</a></li>
      <li>You can find a lot of useful GitHub Actions at the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=&type=actions&verification=">GitHub Marketplace</a></li>
      <li>Some actions, triggers, and steps will only affect the default branch, which can make testing a bit hard. You might want to fork a project while you're experimenting with workflows</li>
      <li>If you want to create packages/artifacts or similar based off of actions is to have a step use a web tool like curl or a script to call the GitHub API and a GitHub secret that stores a Personal Access Token..</li>
