    <h1>University of Illinois GitHub Service Community Portal</h1>
    <p>Community-supported documentation for the University of Illinois GitHub service, designed to fill the gap between
      AITS' service-level documentation and 1-on-1 training by providing a searchable archive of community questions and
      resources.</p>
    <p>
      These resources may be other github orgs, repos, or gists; links to documentation; or simply answers to questions.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/uillinois-community/uillinois-community.github.io/issues">Ask a question &rarr;</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Use</h2>
    <p>
      The repo consists of 3 components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/uillinois-community/uillinois-community.github.io/issues">Issue tracker</a></li>
      <li><a href="index.html">GitHub Pages page</a></li>
      <li><a href="README.md">Readme file</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The issue tracker is the main point of interaction. Service users may submit questions to be answered by
      other campus users. Valuable or high-volume questions may be added to the project at the discretion of the
      maintainers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The web page and readme file currently serve the same purpose--catching users and directing them to the issue
      tracker. Their purposes may diverge as the project grows, with one providing instructions for repository/org
      maintenance and the other serving as the project's front door.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maintainers should avoid duplicating resources whenever possible. For example, users should be referred to
      existing projects unless their question is so specific to the U of I environment that it is out of scope for that
      repo. Likewise, any repos hosted under this org should focus on general github use at the University of Illinois.
    </p>

    <h2>Alternate/Supplemental Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Replicate <a href="https://github.com/explore">GitHub Explore</a> for university- or campus-specific orgs and
        repos.</li>
    </ul>
