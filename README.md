# University of Illinois GitHub Service Community Portal

Community-supported documentation for the University of Illinois GitHub service, designed to fill the gap between AITS' service-level documentation and 1-on-1 training by providing a searchable archive of community questions and resources.

These resources may be other github orgs, repos, or gists; links to documentation; or simply answers to questions.

## Proposed Use

The repo consists of 3 components:

- [Issue tracker](https://github.com/uillinois-community/uillinois-community.github.io/issues)
- [GitHub Pages page](index.html)
- [Readme file](README.md)

The issue tracker is the main point of interaction. Campus service users may submit questions to be answered by other campus users. Valuable or high-volume questions may be added to the project at the discretion of the maintainers.

The web page and readme file currently serve the same purpose--catching users and directing them to the issue tracker. Their purposes may diverge as the project grows, with one providing instructions for repository/org maintenance and the other serving as the project's front door.

Maintainers should avoid duplicating resources whenever possible. For example, users should be referred to existing projects unless their question is so specific to the U of I environment that it is out of scope for that repo. Likewise, any repos hosted under this org should focus on general github use at the University of Illinois.

## Alternate/Supplemental Use Cases

- Replicate [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) for university- or campus-specific orgs and repos.
